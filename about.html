            <h1>The story behind our adventure blog</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ellen and this is my boyfriend Samuel and I's blog about our great Greek adventure! We first had the idea of this blog when we vistited Athens in 2018 and realised how many islands there were ferrys to. In the years after we saved up and planned our trip carefully. Did you know Greece consists of 227 islands? Well, we didn't either! Sure we heard about the popular ones, but we could probably count them on both hands. So we decided to explore some of them!</p>
