This is a website for a travel blog.
        
## Description
In this project I set out to make a travel blog about Greek Islands. I tried to incorporate all of the skills I had gained the past 9 months in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a responsive website. The design plays on Greek features, sea green water and pink flowers, with beautiful imagery. I set out to make a home page, an about page, a contact page, a page of all blog posts and a blog specific page. I developed more certainty in my HTML and CSS skills, learned more JavaScript and I discovered that I clearly have a lot more to learn. I also learned how to make my site WCAG compliant and accessible. I used WordPress for my blog posts and called them to my site using REST API.
